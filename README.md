This is a Shiny App I created using the 'Life Expectancy 2000-2015' dataset from Kaggle. This data includes life expectancy data among other descriptive variables like GDP per capita, CO2 Emissions, Health Expenditure, and even Beer Consumption for 119 countries.

The Shiny App allows you to plot any variables from this dataset against each other and should serve as a resource for identifying relationships before further data analysis.
